#From now on this is a working copy of the crating system

#Crafting system

##**Elements** are primal matter that can be combined to create materials

##**Materials** can be modified to create Parts and Objects

##**Parts** can be combined to create Objects

1. Parts have fittings, like puzzle pieces, and that's what allow you to combine them into objects

##**Objects** are final products that can be interacted with or used for a purpose.

###Objects can also be combined, like bullets for a gun



1. Design the basic building blocks: Atoms are the smallest unit of matter, so you will need to create the different types of de.cicerohellmann.crafting.models.getAtoms that players can work with in your game. You might also want to include subatomic particles such as protons, neutrons, and electrons.


2. Design the crafting recipes: Players will need to know what combinations of de.cicerohellmann.crafting.models.getAtoms and subatomic particles they can use to craft different objects. You will need to create a list of crafting recipes that outline the specific quantities of each type of atom or subatomic particle needed to craft a specific object.


3. Implement a user interface: Players will need a way to access the crafting system and view the available recipes. You will need to design a user interface that allows players to select the specific de.cicerohellmann.crafting.models.getAtoms and subatomic particles they have available and see what objects they can craft with them.


4. Create the crafting process: Once players have chosen the de.cicerohellmann.crafting.models.getAtoms and subatomic particles they want to use and the object they want to craft, you will need to implement the actual crafting process. This might involve visualizing the de.cicerohellmann.crafting.models.getAtoms and subatomic particles coming together to form the desired object, or it might involve simply adding the newly crafted object to the player's inventory.


5. Test and balance the crafting system: Once you have implemented the crafting system, you will need to test it to make sure it is functioning correctly and is balanced. This might involve adjusting the quantities of de.cicerohellmann.crafting.models.getAtoms and subatomic particles required for different crafting recipes, or adding new recipes to the list.
